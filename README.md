# Student Record System
Student Record System is is a school system project based on **OOP**.

# How does it work?
- The system has 3 main modes:
  - admin mode
  - teacher mode
  - student mode

- when you log in with admin mode, you can do anything.
- when you log in with teacher mode, you can only do the privileges of teacher, and same if you log in with student mode.

# Thoughts
- The Project helped me strengthen my knowledge of OOP concepts: *abstraction*, *encapsulation*, *polymorphism*, *inheritance*
